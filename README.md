ðŸŒ—ðŸš€ Day 24 of My JavaScript Journey: Embracing the Ambiance with Dark/Light Modes!

Today, I delved into the realm of design and user preference, creating a page with both Dark and Light Modes. Here's what I accomplished:

ðŸŒ“ Dynamic Theme Switching: I implemented a seamless transition between Dark and Light Modes, allowing users to personalize their browsing experience.

ðŸ’¡ User Preference: I learned how to store and retrieve user preferences, ensuring a consistent theme across sessions.

Join me as I continue to enhance the visual aesthetics and user interaction on the web!
